## 🧠 The Process

The purpose of this project was to improve my programming logic through this well-known game, which includes different game states such as initialGame (the initial board state), win (when the player wins), and GameOver (when the game ends).

I started by building an initial board model that is displayed when the game loads. The next step was to validate the user's moves, making sure they follow the rules for both rows and columns, and also preventing the repetition of numbers (1–9) in each square.

If a move is incorrect, an error message will appear. Upon completing the game correctly, a confetti animation will be triggered to celebrate the victory.
